# Flutter & Firebase Authentication 

Source code based on app developed for the disaster management and prediction of  Natural Disasters:

#Features:
-
-> A Clean UI with minimalistic design
-> Built in flutter for multi-platform support
-> Secure Firebase Integration for seamless authentication.
-> Multiple RadioButtons with multiple features some of which are:
   -> FrontPage SOS design with immediate redirection to calls.
   -> Further error indication of Password and Login with immediate updation of new accounts.
   -> Button that redirects to a Map that previews our predicted/observed Earthquakes in real time.
   -> Button that redirects to a prediction based probability calculator that predicts the possibility 
      of earthquake depending on the stress acting on a virtual 3D plot of the region.
    
#Features coming soon:
-
-> Depending on the place of distress call, establish a peer to peer connection that alerts people around you, who are integrated           to the same app.
-> Further prediction of a range of natural disasters such as storm, hurricanes, cyclones, etc.
-> Added biometric authentication for faster access to maps.
